#CG2AT-Traj

CG2AT-Traj is a program to convert a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation trajectory to an all-atom trajectory.

This project started on Sat Oct 17 2015 as part of a "hack day" at the CECAM workshop for "Setting up simulations".

The original hack day team:
 * Sebastian Kelm (https://github.com/skelm)
 * Rohith Mohan (https://github.com/rohithmohan)
 * Willy Evangeslista (https://github.com/wevangelista)

Team mentor: Phil Stansfeld (University of Oxford)

This project is built on the foundation of MemProtMD by Phil Stansfeld:  http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/memprotmd
